### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1=5khz | f1'=3.5khz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=1.5Mhz | f2'=5.5khz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl =1.495hz \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 546.5khz\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 26.52\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 11.12\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | Go=18.75 | Go'=7.86 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
